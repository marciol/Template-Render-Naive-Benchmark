This is a simple test of the most knowing rendering engines from the Ruby, Lua en Golang.

To test ERB from Ruby:

    time ruby test.rb

To test Cosmo from Lua (Kepler project):

    time lua test.lua

    OBS: Need to have the lua and luarocks installed

To test html/template from Golang 

    go build test.go
    time ./test

The average in my machine, Macbook Pro i5

Ruby - ERB: 
    real    0m0.078s

Lua - Cosmo:
    real    0m0.054s

Luajit - Cosmo:
    real    0m0.041s
    

Golang - html/package
    real    0m0.038s
